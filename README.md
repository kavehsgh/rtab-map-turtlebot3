# rtab-map-turtlebot3
This is a simple tutorial for those who need to practice with ROS and Gazebo simulator. Also you can learn a little about SLAM and [RTAB-Map](http://introlab.github.io/rtabmap/) algorithims.


## How to Start

ROS version: Noetic

OS: Ubuntu 20.4

Gazebo Version: 11

I am assuming that you did install [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation) and [Gazebo](https://classic.gazebosim.org/).
